# Skopeo CI/Dev image

The contents of this directory are intended to be utilized via
the `Makefile` at the top of the repository.  Typically as
`make skopeo_cidev IMG_SFX=<id>`.  The resultant image is utilized
as part of the [skopeo project's](https://github.com/containers/skopeo)
development and CI automation.  It should not be used outside
of those contexts.
